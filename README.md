# DEIA ZSH THEME

A semi-minimalist zsh theme which highlights cpu usage, command exit codes and makes commands more readable.
Works only if zsh and oh-my-zsh are installed.

## Installation: 
1. git clone https://github.com/AOSXAP/deia.zsh_theme.git
2. cd ./deia.zsh_theme && cp ./deia.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
3. edit ~/.zshrc and set ZSH_THEME value to "deia"
4. execute ```source ~/.zshrc```
